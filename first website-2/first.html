<p>Editors of the <strong>English Wikipedia</strong> have pioneered some ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include "featured articles",[11] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[12] navigation templates,[13] the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[14] dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[15] and collaborations.[16]</p>
